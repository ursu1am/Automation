Usage

This sample script will: - ask user to input the file name with the CLI template to be configured - validate the provided file name exists - open the file - select the IPv4 addresses to be configured on interfaces - validate if the selected IPv4 addresses are valid IPv4 addresses - Verify if the IPv4 addresses are: - Used by a network device - Used by a client - Reachable - deploying the configuration template will create an IPv4 address conflict if any of the above validations fail for one IPv4 address

https://github.com/cisco-en-programmability/dnacenter_path_trace.git
This Python script will perform Path Trace between two clients in the Cisco DNA Center managed network.
Path Trace is a excellent tool to assist in troubleshooting connectivity between a source device and destination device.
Path Trace will collect the path information for specified source and destination IPv4 addresses, and optional, source and destination port numbers, and protocol number.
It will collect also information about in-path statistics for interfaces, interface configured ACLs and QoS policies, 
and device statistics
