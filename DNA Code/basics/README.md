# APIC-EM-code

This folder includes sample code to be used with APIC-EM DevNet Sandbox, or other APIC-EM controllers.

View each script using your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Observe the functions and each API call.

Recommendation - run the scripts with the IP or MAC addresses provided at the beginning of each of examples.
Please run the sample code by following the sequence number of each script

1.   check_IP_client.py
    This simple script will find out if there is a client connected to the Enterprise network
    It will ask the user to input an IP address for a client device.
    It will print information if the input IP address is being used by a client or not

2.   check_IP_network_device.py
    This simple script will find out if there is a network device interface configured with an IP address
    It will ask the user to input an IP address to be validated
    It will print information if the input IP address is configured on a network device interface or not

3.   get_IP_client_info.py
    This simple script will find out if there is a client connected to the Enterprise network
    It will ask the user to input an IP address for a client device.
    It will print information if the input IP address is being used by a client or not
    It will find out information about the client, and the connectivity info, switch and wireless AP,
    interface connectivity, VLAN information
    There is a loop that will allow running the validation multiple times, until user input is 'q'

4.   get_mac_client_info.py
    This simple script will find out if there is a client connected to the Enterprise network
    It will ask the user to input a MAC address for a client device.
    It will print information if the input MAC address is being used by a client or not
    It will find out information about the client, and the connectivity info, switch and wireless AP,
    interface connectivity, VLAN information, and IP address associated with the MAC
    There is a loop that will allow running the validation multiple times, until user input is 'q'

5.   check_duplicate_IP.py
    This script will validate if user provided IP addresses are already configured on a network device,
    either if the interface is up or down. It will also validate if a client may be using the IP address.
    If the IP address is being used, it will return the hostname of the network device
    the model and the interface configured with the IP address.
    If the IP address is used by a client it will provide or the hostname of the network device connected to the client,
    the model, and the interface connected to the client using the IP address.
    A while loop will allow to check multiple IP addresses, until user input is 'q'

6.   get_device_license.py
    This application will create a list of all the APIC-EM discovered network devices, their serial numbers and
    active software licenses.
    We will access a DevNet Sandbox to run this script.
    Changes to the APIC-EM url, username and password are required if desired to access a different APIC-EM controller.

7.   switchport_inventory.py
    This application will create a list of all the APIC-EM discovered network switches, their serial numbers and
    active software licenses.
    We will append to each switch an inventory for each access port: switchport number, switchport mode, native VLAN,
    voice VLAN, MAC address connected to each switchport (coming)
    We will access a DevNet Sandbox to run this script.
    Changes to the APIC-EM url, username and password are required if desired to access a different APIC-EM controller.
